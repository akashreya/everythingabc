# Google AI Studio Setup Guide

Google AI Studio provides a generous free tier for image generation, making it a great alternative to OpenAI's DALL-E.

## Step 1: Get Your Google AI API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

## Step 2: Set Environment Variable

Add the following line to your `.env` file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
```

## Step 3: Test the Integration

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
npm run test-google-ai
```

## Models Available

Choose from these Gemini models:
- **gemini-2.0-flash** âš¡ (Default) - Fast and efficient
- **gemini-2.5-flash-lite** ðŸª¶ - Lightweight version  
- **gemini-2.5-pro** ðŸš€ - Most capable model

## Free Tier Limits

Google AI Studio free tier includes:
- **15 requests per minute**
- **1,500 requests per day**  
- **1 million tokens per month**

This is much more generous than OpenAI's free trial!

## Features Supported

âœ… **Enhanced Prompt Generation** - Uses Gemini to create better image prompts
âœ… **Multiple Styles** - Photographic, Illustration, Artistic, etc.
âœ… **Category Optimization** - Optimized prompts for different categories
âœ… **Quality Control** - Integrated with existing quality scoring
âœ… **Cost Tracking** - Monitors usage and estimated costs

## Note on Image Generation

**Important**: Google AI Studio (Gemini) doesn't directly generate images like DALL-E. Instead, it:

1. **Enhances Prompts** - Creates detailed, optimized prompts for image generation
2. **Provides Structured Output** - Returns enhanced prompts that can be used with other image generation services
3. **Offers Text-to-Image Guidance** - Provides detailed descriptions for manual image creation

This approach is perfect for:
- Creating better prompts for other AI image generators
- Generating detailed descriptions for manual image sourcing
- Enhancing existing image collection workflows

## Integration with Other Services

The enhanced prompts generated by Google AI can be used with:
- Stable Diffusion (local or cloud)
- Midjourney (via Discord)
- Other AI image generation services
- Manual image sourcing with better descriptions

## Cost Comparison

| Provider | Free Tier | Cost per Image |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Google AI Studio | 1.5M tokens/month | ~$0.001 (prompt enhancement) |
| OpenAI DALL-E 3 | $5 credit (expires) | $0.040-0.080 |

Google AI Studio is significantly more cost-effective for prompt generation and text processing!
